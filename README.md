# Image-Classification
A convolution network neural network in Keras with Python using CIFAR-10 dataset

CIFAR-10: This dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 10 target classes, with each category containing 6000 images of shape 32*32. 
This dataset contains images of low resolution (32*32), which allows researchers to try new algorithms. The 10 different classes of this dataset are:

    Airplane
    Car
    Bird
    Cat
    Deer
    Dog
    Frog
    Horse
    Ship
    Truck

This dataset is available in Keras
